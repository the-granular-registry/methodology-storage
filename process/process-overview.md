# Process Overview

The Power Emissions Certificate (PEC) methodology integrates energy storage operations with carbon accounting and renewable energy tracking. The process ensures environmental integrity, transparency, and alignment with established standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) and the EnergyTag Standard. Below is a step-by-step overview of the process:

## **1. Data Collection**

* **Objective**: Gather essential data for accurately assessing the carbon impact of charging and discharging activities.
* **Details**:
  * Hourly energy consumption and discharge data from storage system meters.
  * Corresponding marginal emissions rates (MERs) sourced from approved emissions data providers.
  * Geographic and temporal alignment of MERs with project-specific grid conditions.

## **2. Assess Charging Inventory and Impact**

* **Objective**: Evaluate the emissions inventory and impact associated with charging activities.
* **Details**:
  * Align hourly charging data with corresponding MERs to compute induced emissions as part of the emissions inventory.
  * Use temporal and locational MER data to ensure accuracy in assessing the emissions footprint of charging.
  * Document all inputs, calculations, and results, including energy consumed, MERs, and the resulting emissions inventory.

## **3. Source PECs for Charging Inventory**

* **Objective**: Use PECs to attribute renewable energy generation to the charging activity.
* **Details**:
  * Source PECs from renewable generation facilities within the same balance authority and corresponding to the charging hours.
  * Cancel PECs in the registry to assign renewable attributes to the charging activity, ensuring alignment with Scope 2 reporting principles.
  * Record all PEC cancellations and their alignment with the charging inventory for traceability and verification purposes.

## **4. Verify Data and Impacts**

* **Objective**: Validate the accuracy of emissions calculations and ensure compliance with the methodology, the EnergyTag Standard, and the GHG Protocol.
* **Details**:
  * Submit project impact data, including meter readings, MERs, and canceled PECs, to the PEC registry.
  * The registry conducts quality checks to verify data integrity and ensure compliance with PEC methodology requirements.
  * Include a review of net emissions impact to confirm that the avoided emissions from discharging exceed the induced emissions from charging.
  * Generate a Power Emissions Proof (PEP) report certifying that all calculations, alignments, and compliance standards are met.

## **5. PEC Issuance for Discharging Activity**

* **Objective**: Issue PECs representing the net avoided emissions of discharged energy.
* **Details**:
  * Calculate gross avoided emissions for each discharge hour using MERs.
  * Adjust for remaining induced emissions from charging that were not accounted for with PECs.
  * Issue PECs only for hours with positive net avoided emissions.
  * Ensure all issued PECs include timestamps, location data, and references to the associated PEP and canceled PECs.

## **6. PEC Transfer and Retirement**

* **Objective**: Enable stakeholders to claim emissions reductions accurately.
* **Details**:
  * PECs are transferred to end-users (e.g., corporate buyers) for voluntary reporting.
  * End-users retire PECs to account for Scope 2 market-based emissions reductions and align with 24/7 renewable energy commitments.

## **Key Benefits of the Process**

* **Transparency**: Ensures traceable, auditable records for every PEC transaction.
* **Environmental Integrity**: Prevents double counting and upholds emissions reduction principles.
* **Compliance**: Aligns with GHGP guidance and EnergyTag standards, facilitating robust corporate reporting.
