# Process Overview

1. Data Collection
2. Assess Charging Impact
3. Neutralize Charging Impact
4. Registry Verification of Impact Report
5. PEC Issuance, Transfer and Retirement

## Data Collection

Project location and hourly meter data are collected for each reporting interval.  This data is used to select the emissions data provider according to the PECA guidelines and calculate carbon impact.

## Neutralize Charging Activity

The storage operator must neutralize charging activity according to the EnergyTag Standard AND demonstrate no net increase in emissions.

1. **Hourly Matching:** PECs are sourced and retired to match charging hours, complying with the EnergyTag Standard. The PECs must be sourced from the same balance authority as the energy consumption.
2. **Carbon Impact:**  The carbon impact of the neutralized charging activity (induced emissions) must be less than or equal to that of the discharge activity (avoided emissions). This condition is essential to avoid increasing emissions when time-shifting CFE generation. &#x20;

## Registry Verification of Impact Report

A project impact report will be submitted to the PEC registry to verify the meter data, emissions data, and retired PECs. Upon completion, a Power Emissions Proof (PEP) will be created to certify the charging impact is neutralized. The PEP will be traceable from all issued PECs.

## PEC Issuance, Transfer, and Retirement

Like other CFE generation projects, the PEC Registry will issue PECs for all discharged energy. For details, see the PEC whitepaper and methodology.
