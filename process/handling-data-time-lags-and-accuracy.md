# Handling Data Time Lags and Accuracy

**Data Time Lags**

Some emissions data providers may experience delays in publishing MER data due to the time required for data collection, processing, and validation. These time lags can range from a few days to several months, depending on the grid and data provider.

#### **Strategies for Managing Time Lags**

* **Delayed PEC Issuance**: Wait until the MER data is available before finalizing induced emissions calculations and issuing PECs.
* **Interim Estimates**: Use preliminary MER data where available, with the understanding that adjustments may be necessary once final data is released.
* **Communication with Stakeholders**: Inform relevant parties about potential delays in PEC issuance due to data availability constraints.

## **Ensuring Data Accuracy**

### **Selection of Reliable Data Providers**

* **Compliance with PECA Guidelines**: Choose emissions data providers that adhere to the criteria outlined in the PECA guidelines.
* **Data Validation Processes**: Ensure that providers have robust methodologies for data collection and validation.

### **Verification of MER Data**

* **Cross-Referencing**: Compare MER data from multiple sources, if possible, to identify discrepancies.
* **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyze historical MER trends to assess the reasonableness of current data.

### **Documentation of Data Sources and Methodologies**

* **Detailed Records**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of the emissions data sources, including:
  * Provider details.
  * Data acquisition dates.
  * Methodologies used by the provider to calculate MER.
* **Transparency**: Provide this documentation as part of the project impact report submitted to the PEC Registry.

### **Example of Handling Data Time Lags**

Suppose an energy storage project in the ERCOT grid experiences a 60-day delay in MER data publication:

* **Impact on PEC Issuance**: PECs for the affected period cannot be issued until the accurate MER data is available.
* **Operational Adjustments**:
  * Plan for the delay in financial and operational projections.
  * Communicate with corporate buyers regarding the expected timeline.
* **Data Update**: Once the MER data is published, proceed with induced emissions calculations and PEC issuance promptly.
