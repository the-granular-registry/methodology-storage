## “Virtual Hybrid” (stand-alone storage)

This use case enables a corporate offtaker to sell GCs from an operational renewable PPA to a battery to neutralize charging activity. The battery operator then sells the issued GCs back to the same offtaker to enhance the offtaker’s carbon impact and capture the carbon arbitrage. This effectively increases the total avoided emissions, even considering the roundtrip efficiency losses.
