# What are Power Emissions Certificates?

PECs are a comprehensive solution that combines all attributes of EACs into one asset, providing clear ownership and a more accurate representation of carbon-free energy generation or storage discharge's environmental, community, and conservation benefits.&#x20;

Built on established EAC registries, PECs provide an additional data layer to enhance the usefulness of EACs. The underlying retired EACs allow PECs to align with the current Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) Scope 2 guidance while enhancing voluntary reporting. PECs represent:

* **Retired EAC:** Every PEC is backed by a retired EAC in a local registry.
* **Carbon Impact:** A historical estimate based on the time and location of CFE generation and marginal resource displaced on the grid, according to the data source methodology.
* **Hourly Timestamp:** Comply with the EnergyTag Standard as a GC Issuer.
* **Additionality Indicators:** Relevant project metadata and context are collected to help assess whether the PECs provide incremental climate benefit.
