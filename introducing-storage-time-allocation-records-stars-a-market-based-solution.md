# Introducing Storage Time Allocation Records (STARs): A Market-Based Solution

To bridge the gap between the capabilities of energy storage and the demands of advanced corporate decarbonization strategies, Granular Registry introduces Storage Time Allocation Records (STARs). STARs function as a novel environmental commodity, issued and tracked within the Granular Registry, designed specifically to represent and commoditize the verifiable time-shifting of clean energy attributes through registered storage facilities.

## Conceptual Framework: Commoditizing the Temporal Value of Storage

At its core, a STAR represents the certified right to allocate the environmental attributes of a specific quantity of energy from the time it was charged into a storage facility to the time it was discharged, accounting for efficiency losses. This concept draws parallels with how RECs successfully unbundled the "renewable" attribute from the physical electron, creating a liquid market for that specific characteristic.<sup>5</sup> Similarly, STARs aim to unbundle and commoditize the "time-shifted" attribute enabled by storage.

Key aspects of this framework include:

* **Distinct Commodity:** STARs are treated as a unique environmental attribute certificate, separate from the underlying energy.
* **Registry-Based Issuance:** STARs are issued exclusively by the Granular Registry to pre-qualified, metered energy storage facilities, ensuring standardized verification and tracking.<sup>14</sup>
* **Decoupling Service from Operation:** STARs allow buyers to procure the verified outcome of time-shifting without needing to engage in the complexities of battery operation, dispatch, or energy market arbitrage. These operational aspects remain the responsibility of the storage asset owner/operator. This separation allows for specialization – storage operators focus on efficient physical operation and market participation, while attribute buyers concentrate on meeting their CFE or emissionality goals.
* **Market Mechanism:** The creation of STARs facilitates a market where the temporal flexibility provided by storage can be explicitly valued and traded. This includes price signals that can influence storage investment decisions and operational strategies, potentially rewarding dispatch patterns that align with decarbonization goals.<sup>1</sup>

By transforming the service of attribute time-shifting into a tradable asset, STARs enable market-based price discovery for this specific capability. This commoditization is fundamental to achieving the scale, liquidity, and transparency necessary to fully integrate storage into advanced clean energy procurement strategies, thereby moving beyond the limitations of bespoke, non-standardized approaches, such as tolling agreements.

## STAR Mechanics: Linking Charge, Discharge, and Losses

The STAR mechanism operates within the ecosystem of the Granular Registry and relies on EnergyTag-compliant Granular Certificates (GCs) as the foundational unit of time-stamped clean energy.<sup>2</sup> The process ensures a verifiable chain of custody from initial generation through storage to the final time-shifted claim:

1. **GC Allocation to Charge Event:** When clean energy, represented by a valid GC held by an account holder (e.g., a corporate buyer with a PPA), is intended to be time-shifted, the GC is allocated for charging into a specific, registered storage unit within the Granular Registry. Simultaneously, the registry creates a Storage Charge Record (SCR) associated with that storage unit for the specific charging time interval. The SCR documents the quantity of energy charged (in Wh for granularity), the charge timestamp, and inherits the essential attributes (fuel type, location, original generation time, etc.) from the allocated GC. The original GC is effectively retired or reserved, with a purpose code indicating "for storage charging," which prevents its use elsewhere.<sup>12</sup>
2. **Discharge Event Recording:** When the storage unit discharges energy, the Granular Registry creates a Storage Discharge Record (SDR) for that discharge time interval. The SDR documents the quantity of energy discharged (in Wh, reflecting losses) and the discharge timestamp.<sup>12</sup>
3. **STAR Issuance:** This is where the core innovation takes place. Based on verified meter data for both charge and discharge, and applying strict operational rules (FIFO allocation and loss accounting, detailed below), the Granular Registry links a specific SCR (or portion thereof) to a corresponding SDR. Upon successful linkage, the Registry issues a Storage Time Allocation Record (STAR) to the account holder of the storage facility. The STAR is a tradable certificate containing unique identifiers and critical data linking the charge and discharge events: star\_id, scr\_id, sdr\_id, and the calculated round\_trip\_loss\_wh.
4. **STAR Retirement and SD-GC Creation:** An energy buyer seeking to make a time-shifted claim acquires the necessary STAR(s) from the storage operator or secondary market. To finalize the claim, the buyer retrieves the STAR(s) along with the corresponding original GC(s) (those referenced in the STAR via the SCR) within the Granular Registry. This joint retirement triggers the issuance of a final, non-tradable Storage-Discharge Granular Certificate (SD-GC) to the buyer.<sup>12</sup>
5. **Final Claim Substantiation:** The SD-GC serves as the ultimate evidence for the time-shifted clean energy claim. It inherits non-temporal attributes (such as fuel type and generator location) from the original GC. Crucially, its timestamp reflects the _discharge_ interval recorded in the SDR. It also immutably references the unique star\_id, providing a verifiable link back to the specific storage event, the associated SCR and SDR, the original GC, and the accounted losses. Optionally, for emissionality use cases, the SD-GC can also carry the calculated net carbon impact (ΔMER) associated with the time-shift.

The STAR thus functions as an essential, auditable "bridge" within the registry. It connects the attributes of the original clean energy (captured in the GC and SCR) to the final point of use in time (represented by the SDR and SD-GC), ensuring that the transformation process adheres to defined rules and physical constraints, particularly regarding energy losses and temporal sequencing. This multi-stage, registry-managed process is designed to eliminate double-counting and provide the transparency required for credible CFE and impact claims.

## Ensuring Credibility: FIFO Allocation, Loss Accounting, and Audit Trails

The integrity and market acceptance of STARs hinge on rigorous adherence to operational rules that reflect physical realities and employ robust digital security measures. Three pillars underpin this credibility:

* **First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Allocation:** The Granular Registry employs a strict FIFO methodology when linking SCRs to SDRs.<sup>63</sup> This means that the energy attributes associated with the earliest charging interval (represented by an SCR) must be allocated to the earliest discharging interval (SDR) requiring those attributes. This prevents "cherry-picking" or temporal arbitrage, where a storage operator might try to artificially pair GCs from low-cost charging periods with high-value discharging periods, irrespective of the actual physical flow of energy through the battery. FIFO ensures the temporal link reflects a plausible physical sequence of operations.<sup>12</sup>
* **Round-Trip Efficiency (RTE) Accounting:** Energy storage systems are not perfectly efficient; energy is inevitably lost during the charge, storage, and discharge cycle.<sup>46</sup> STARs mandate accurate accounting for these round-trip losses.<sup>12</sup> The energy quantity recorded in the SDR (energy out) must be less than or equal to the energy quantity in the linked SCR (energy in), adjusted by the system's RTE. The STAR itself records the calculated round\_trip\_loss\_wh, making the efficiency accounting transparent. The specific methodology for determining RTE (e.g., based on manufacturer specifications, periodic testing, or real-time operational data) must be documented and verifiable, aligning with principles like those outlined in EnergyTag's Annex 2.<sup>12</sup> This ensures that the final SD-GC represents a physically deliverable quantity of energy attributes, preventing claims inflation.
* **Immutable Audit Trails:** Every object within the Granular Registry (GC, SCR, SDR, STAR, SD-GC) is assigned a unique identifier and cryptographically linked to related objects. All transactions – issuance, transfer between accounts, allocation, and retirement – are recorded in an immutable ledger. This creates a complete, verifiable history for each time-shifted MWh. To further enhance security and trust, the registry may employ techniques such as:
  * **JSON Web Signatures (JWS):** Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of registry records using standard cryptographic signatures.<sup>66</sup>
  * Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Potentially used to manage the identities of participants (registry, operators, buyers) and allow for decentralized verification of credentials like STARs.<sup>69</sup>
  * **Blockchain Anchoring:** Periodically anchoring cryptographic summaries (e.g., Merkle roots) of the registry state onto a public blockchain to provide external, publicly verifiable tamper-evidence against retroactive data manipulation.<sup>73</sup>

These rigorous operational rules and security features directly address the weaknesses of informal or opaque tracking methods.<sup>5</sup> By grounding STARs in verifiable physical principles and leveraging robust digital infrastructure, the Granular Registry aims to establish STARs as a highly credible and trustworthy instrument for the energy market.
