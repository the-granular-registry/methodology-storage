# Conclusion: STARs - The Missing Link for Valuing Energy Storage

The transition to a deeply decarbonized electricity grid hinges on the effective integration of both variable renewable energy and energy storage. While energy storage offers the critical capability to bridge the temporal gap between intermittent generation and continuous demand, existing market mechanisms have failed to adequately recognize and value this time-shifting service in the context of environmental attribute tracking.<sup>5</sup> This oversight hinders the ability of corporations to achieve ambitious 24/7 CFE goals credibly and prevents the market from fully leveraging storage for maximum carbon impact through emissionality strategies. The current reliance on complex tolling agreements or inadequate manual tracking methods creates barriers to scaling, transparency, and auditability.

Storage Time Allocation Records (STARs), issued and managed through the Granular Registry, provide the essential missing link. By commoditizing the verifiable act of time-shifting clean energy attributes, STARs introduce a standardized, transparent, and market-based solution.<sup>14</sup> Built upon EnergyTag-compliant Granular Certificates and employing rigorous operational rules like FIFO allocation and precise loss accounting, STARs ensure the integrity and credibility of time-shifted claims.<sup>12</sup>

The benefits are clear: STARs empower corporate buyers to meet advanced decarbonization targets with reduced risk and complexity compared to tolling agreements. They provide storage operators with a new revenue stream, incentivizing dispatch patterns that support grid decarbonization. They enable utilities to offer innovative, verifiable green energy products. They offer policymakers a market-based tool to encourage the optimal deployment and utilization of storage assets.

As regulatory frameworks increasingly demand temporal granularity (evidenced by the US 45V hydrogen tax credit rules and evolving EU policies <sup>139</sup>), the need for solutions like STARs becomes paramount. The phased implementation roadmap outlined in this paper provides a pathway for STARs to evolve from pilot projects into a foundational component of global clean energy markets. Achieving this vision requires collaboration across the industry – buyers embracing granular procurement, operators leveraging new value streams, registries ensuring interoperability, and policymakers recognizing the role of standardized attribute tracking. STARs represent a critical innovation, poised to unlock the full potential of energy storage and accelerate the transition to a reliable, efficient, and truly carbon-free electricity future.

## Call to Action

The successful integration of Storage Time Allocation Records (STARs) into the energy market requires proactive engagement from all stakeholders. Granular Registry invites industry participants to join in realizing the potential of this innovative instrument:

For Corporate Energy Buyers & Sustainability Leaders:

* **Explore STARs:** Evaluate how STARs can enhance your 24/7 CFE coverage or emissionality impact, providing a more credible and transparent alternative to traditional methods.

●      Pilot Procurement: Engage with Granular Registry and the Granular Registry to participate in pilot programs for procuring STARs and integrating them into your energy attribute portfolio management.

●      Advocate for Recognition: Support the recognition of STARs and underlying granular certificate methodologies within corporate reporting frameworks (e.g., CDP, RE100) and evolving standards like the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance.

For Energy Storage Operators & Developers:

●      Register Assets: Onboard your utility-scale battery storage facilities onto the Granular Registry to become eligible for STAR issuance.

●      Monetize Time-Shifting: Explore STARs as a distinct revenue stream, potentially commanding premiums based on carbon impact (ΔMER), complementing existing revenues from energy arbitrage and ancillary services.

●      Provide Feedback: Collaborate with Granular Registry to refine operational rules, data reporting requirements, and registry functionalities based on practical experience.

For Utilities & Retail Energy Providers:

●      Develop STAR-Backed Products: Leverage STARs to create innovative green tariffs that offer customers verifiably time-matched clean energy, enhancing product differentiation and credibility.

●      Integrate into Planning: Incorporate STARs into Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) and grid operations modeling as a tool for managing CFE integration and meeting clean energy mandates.

●      Partner for Procurement: Collaborate with storage operators and the Granular Registry to procure STARs for utility-scale needs or customer programs.

For Policymakers & Energy Regulators:

●      Recognize STARs: Formally acknowledge STARs and similar verifiable time-shifting instruments within clean energy standards, RPS compliance frameworks, and grid modernization initiatives.

●      Incentivize Granularity: Design policies that reward temporal matching and carbon impact, creating market pull for solutions like STARs (e.g., ensure 45V implementation guidance supports robust registry-based tracking through storage <sup>139</sup>).

●      Support Registry Development: Encourage and potentially fund upgrades to existing EAC registries and the development of new platforms (like the Granular Registry) capable of handling hourly data, storage logic, and interoperability. Ensure fair market rules that allow storage to capture value from attribute time-shifting.

For EAC/GC Registry Administrators:

●      Collaborate on Interoperability: Work with Granular Registry and standards bodies like EnergyTag to develop and adopt robust standards for inter-registry communication and data exchange, particularly regarding GCs and storage attributes.

●      Explore STAR Compatibility: Evaluate the feasibility of incorporating STAR-compatible logic (FIFO, loss accounting, linking charge/discharge) into existing or future registry platforms to support market growth and user demand.

For Standards Bodies (EnergyTag, GHG Protocol, etc.):

●      Refine Storage Standards: Continue to develop and refine clear, robust standards for tracking energy attributes through storage, addressing allocation methods, loss accounting, and verification.<sup>11</sup>

●      Evaluate STAR Methodology: Assess the STAR concept and its implementation within the Granular Registry for alignment with or potential inclusion in future standard revisions and guidance documents.<sup>86</sup>

The transition to a truly decarbonized grid requires innovation in how we track, value, and trade clean energy attributes. STARs offer a vital step forward, providing the necessary mechanism to integrate energy storage effectively into credible 24/7 CFE and emissionality strategies. Join Granular Registry in building this essential market infrastructure.
