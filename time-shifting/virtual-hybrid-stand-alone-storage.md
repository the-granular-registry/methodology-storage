# “Virtual Hybrid” (stand-alone storage)

## **Overview and Objectives**

This methodology facilitates 24/7 hourly matching using a Virtual Hybrid approach that time-shifts GCs from a solar farm to a battery system, neutralizing emissions by matching all charging energy with renewable GCs. This method streamlines hourly matching and avoids the need for SOC tracking or loss calculations, enhancing transparency and efficiency.

## **Step 1: Solar GC Issuance and Transfer**

* **Data Collection**: Collect hourly generation data from the solar facility and issue GCs with timestamps following the EnergyTag Standard.
* **REC Export to GC Registry**: Transfer RECs to the GC registry trading account, preventing any possibilities of double-counting.

## **Step 2: GC Transfer for Charging Neutralization**

* **Neutralizing Charging Energy**: Transfer and retire enough GCs to match the battery's total charging load hourly. This ensures that all charging energy is 100% carbon-free, eliminating the need to calculate SOC or roundtrip losses.
* **Matching Compliance**: This process satisfies 24/7 matching requirements by ensuring that all stored energy originates from renewable sources.

## **Step 3: Discharge GC Issuance**

* **Discharge Data Collection**: Collect hourly meter data for discharged energy.
* **Issuance of GCs for Discharged Energy**: Issue new GCs corresponding to the battery's hourly discharged energy. These GCs accurately reflect time-shifted renewable energy without requiring SOC or loss adjustments since all charging energy has already been matched with carbon-free energy.

## **Step 4: Final GC Transfer and Retirement by End-User**

* **GC Transfer to End-User**: Transfer the newly issued GCs to the end-user account, allowing for final retirement and ensuring alignment with 24/7 renewable energy commitments.
