# How does the PEC registry deal with the time lag of MER data?

Some data providers calculate MER based on grid operator data releases, which have a time lag in publishing data. REsurety in grids like ERCOT can be up to 60 days. In the project locations where these data providers are selected, PECs will not be issued until the MER data is published. This time lag will not prevent proper hourly matching of charging activity.
