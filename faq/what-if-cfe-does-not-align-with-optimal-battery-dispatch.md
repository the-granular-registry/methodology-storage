# What if CFE does not align with optimal battery dispatch?

There is concern that the timing of renewable generation PECs might not align with optimal battery charging times/operations for maximizing grid emission reductions, depending on location. In the case of a misalignment of CFE in a fully contracted PEC agreement, unbundled PECs from the marketplace can help supplement and add flexibility.
