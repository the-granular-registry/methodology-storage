# STARs vs. Storage Tolling Agreements: A Strategic Comparison

As corporate buyers increasingly seek to leverage energy storage for achieving 24/7 CFE or emissionality goals, they face a choice between existing contractual mechanisms, primarily storage tolling agreements, and emerging market-based instruments like STARs. A comparison reveals significant advantages for STARs, particularly for buyers focused on procuring verifiable environmental attributes rather than managing physical energy assets.

### Navigating Complexity: Contractual Structures and Operational Oversight

Storage tolling agreements are typically bilateral contracts where a buyer (the "toller") pays a fee (the "toll") to a storage asset owner for the right to use the battery's capacity.<sup>9</sup> These agreements are often highly complex, requiring extensive negotiation around operational parameters such as dispatch rights, charging energy procurement, efficiency guarantees, availability metrics, performance penalties, and intricate risk allocation clauses.<sup>9</sup> Critically, tolling frequently necessitates that the buyer possesses sophisticated energy market knowledge and takes an active role in directing the storage asset's dispatch strategy to maximize value or ensure alignment with their CFE needs.<sup>9</sup>

In contrast, procuring STARs represents a fundamentally simpler transaction focused on acquiring a specific, verifiable environmental attribute: the time-shift . The process mirrors the established markets for unbundled RECs or GOs.<sup>31</sup> Buyers contract for STARs via the Granular Registry or secondary markets using standardized terms. The operational complexity and dispatch decisions remain entirely with the storage operator, who is incentivized to operate the asset efficiently to generate STARs (among other potential revenue streams like energy arbitrage or ancillary services) . This abstraction of the time-shifting _outcome_ from the operational _process_ significantly lowers the barrier to entry for corporations whose primary goal is credible sustainability reporting, not active energy trading or asset management.

## Risk Allocation: De-risking Time-Shifting for Energy Buyers

Tolling agreements inherently expose the buyer to numerous risks.<sup>9</sup> Operationally, the buyer may bear risks associated with the battery's actual performance, including degradation impacting capacity or efficiency over time, unexpected outages, or maintenance requirements that limit availability.<sup>64</sup> Market-wise, the buyer is often exposed to volatility in wholesale energy prices (affecting charging costs and discharge revenues), fluctuations in ancillary service market values, and potential changes in regulations that could impact the economics of the storage operation.<sup>9</sup> Furthermore, tolling agreements may necessitate on-balance sheet accounting treatment, impacting corporate financial metrics.

STAR agreements offer a stark contrast by insulating the attribute buyer from these operational and market risks. The storage operator assumes full responsibility and risk associated with asset performance, market price fluctuations, and regulatory changes. The buyer procures a STAR only _after_ a time-shifting event has been successfully completed and verified by the registry. The STAR represents this verified historical outcome. The risk that the storage asset underperforms or that market conditions are unfavorable affects the _operator's_ ability to generate valuable STARs, but it does not impact the buyer who purchases an already-issued STAR. STAR procurement is typically treated as an off-balance-sheet operational expense, which simplifies financial reporting for the buyer. This fundamental shift in risk allocation makes STARs a significantly more attractive proposition for buyers primarily interested in securing the environmental attribute with minimal exposure to the underlying complexities and uncertainties of energy storage operation and markets.

## Market Dynamics: Scalability, Liquidity, and Standardization Advantages

The bespoke, heavily negotiated nature of tolling agreements inherently limits their scalability and prevents the formation of a liquid, efficient market.<sup>9</sup> Each deal requires significant transaction costs and time, making it difficult to deploy storage-enabled CFE strategies across numerous facilities or regions rapidly.

STARs, by design, overcome these limitations through standardization and commoditization. As a defined, registry-tracked instrument with standardized attributes, STARs can be traded efficiently, much like existing EACs.<sup>32</sup> This standardization fosters:

* **Scalability:** Buyers can easily procure STARs from multiple storage facilities across different regions through the Granular Registry or secondary market platforms, enabling rapid scaling of time-shifting strategies.
* **Liquidity:** A standardized instrument attracts more buyers and sellers, increasing market depth and transaction volume. This liquidity reduces search costs and improves the ease of finding counterparties.
* **Price Discovery:** A liquid market allows for transparent price discovery for the time-shifting attribute itself. This provides clear market signals to storage developers and operators regarding the value of offering this service, potentially incentivizing deployment in locations and operations during times that best support CFE and emissionality goals.<sup>1</sup>

The potential for a standardized, liquid STAR market represents a significant improvement over the fragmented and inefficient landscape of bespoke tolling agreements, enabling network effects and market efficiencies previously unattainable for the time-shifting attribute.

## Enhancing Transparency and Auditability for Sustainability Reporting

Verifying claims made under complex tolling agreements can be challenging for corporate sustainability reporting and third-party audits. It often requires scrutinizing intricate contract clauses, analyzing potentially opaque operational meter data provided by the storage operator, and confirming adherence to agreed-upon efficiency and availability parameters. The lack of standardization makes comparisons across different agreements difficult.

STARs, operating within the Granular Registry, offer inherently superior transparency and auditability. The registry provides a centralized, immutable record of each STAR's lifecycle:

* **Clear Linkage:** Each STAR provides a verifiable link from a specific discharge event (SDR) back to the corresponding charge event (SCR) and the original GC(s) used for charging.
* **Verified Data:** Issuance relies on verified meter data and adherence to standardized rules (FIFO, loss accounting) enforced by the registry.<sup>12</sup>
* **Standardized Format:** The attributes and history of each STAR and the resulting SD-GC are recorded in a consistent, machine-readable format.
* **Simplified Audits:** Auditors can easily trace the provenance of an SD-GC claim back through the STAR to the underlying data within the registry via unique identifiers, simplifying the verification process for sustainability reports (e.g., CDP, RE100 submissions) and potential regulatory compliance checks.<sup>15</sup>

This registry-based system provides the robust, transparent, and easily auditable framework necessary for credible claims in the increasingly scrutinized field of corporate sustainability.
