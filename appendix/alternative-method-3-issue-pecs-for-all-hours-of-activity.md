# Alternative Method 3: Issue PECs for All Hours of Activity

Issue PECs for all hours of battery activity, including hours with positive net emissions. Issue carbon-positive PECs for charging activity and carbon-negative PECs for discharging activity. A PEC agreement offtaker would retire all PECs issued to the storage asset, resulting in the same net avoided emissions.

| Does not require net emissions analysis.                                                                                           | Carbon-positive PECs could cause confusion in the market and carbon accounting, even if the net emissions benefits are the same.  |
| Carbon-positive PECs could enable other use cases for loads or fossil generation. Enable emissions matching at the registry level. | It could end up with unretired carbon-positive PECs if the contract offtaker does not retire all PECs issued for a storage asset. |
