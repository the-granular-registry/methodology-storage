# What if the storage asset charges during zero MER hours?

All hours of charging activity must be neutralized with the corresponding PECs. Since the hours of charging have zero MER, the PECs used to neutralize can also have zero MER. During curtailment periods, there is an excess supply of CFE, and a large volume of low-impact PECs are issued. There should be no problem sourcing these PECs.

If higher-impact PECs neutralize charging activity, the excess carbon impact after hourly matching will be passed on to the issued PECs.
