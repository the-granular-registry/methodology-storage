# How are PECs issued for energy storage different than carbon offsets?

Attribute certificates and carbon offsets play critical roles in the clean energy and carbon markets; however, their structure, purpose, and application differ significantly, especially when applied to utility-scale energy storage systems.

PECs offer an alternative approach to carbon offsets for energy storage due to their precise alignment with actual energy generation and usage patterns. Unlike carbon offsets, based on counterfactual baselines, attribute certificates are directly tied to the specific environmental attributes of the electricity generated, stored, and discharged. This granularity allows for a more accurate and transparent accounting of the emissions impact of energy storage operations. By using hourly data and understanding the marginal emissions at each location on the grid, PECs ensure that the real-time benefits of energy storage —such as reducing reliance on fossil fuels during peak demand periods— are properly quantified and rewarded.
